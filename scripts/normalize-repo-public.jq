# Project GET /repos/{owner}/{repo} down to the settings-like fields that are
# visible WITHOUT authentication on a public repo (verified 2026-07-13:
# identical output from an admin-token and an anonymous response). Volatile
# fields (counts, timestamps, description, topics) are deliberately excluded.
# Admin-gated fields (merge methods, security_and_analysis) live in
# repo-admin-snapshot.json. The license field is deliberately absent: it is
# content-derived (GitHub's detector over the LICENSE file), not a
# control-plane setting — tracking it here would false-drift on a license
# file edit or a detector change (Codex review, PR #188).
