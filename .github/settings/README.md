# Repo settings as code

This directory is the **declared state** of the GitHub control plane for this
repository — the one part of the delivery environment that is not already
version-controlled code. A personal-account repo has no audit log, so these
baselines + the weekly drift check are the only reviewable record of
settings changes.

| File | Contents | Drift-checked |
|---|---|---|
| `ruleset-<name>.json` | One per live ruleset, normalized (`scripts/normalize-ruleset.jq`) | Weekly, by `settings-drift.yml` |
| `repo-public.json` | Anonymous-visible repo settings (`scripts/normalize-repo-public.jq`) | Weekly, by `settings-drift.yml` |
| `repo-admin-snapshot.json` | Admin-only settings: merge methods, security & analysis toggles, Actions policy + selected-actions allowlist, ruleset bypass actors, classic branch protection (recorded as `null` since its deliberate retirement, 2026-07-13), secrets/hooks/keys inventory | **No** — reading these needs `administration` scope, which the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot hold, and adding a standing PAT for that purpose is against the zero-standing-secrets posture. Refreshed manually. |

## Process rule — settings changes go PR-first

1. Open a PR that updates the relevant file(s) here to the **intended** state
   (describe the why in the PR body).
2. Merge it (green checks as usual).
3. Apply the change in GitHub (UI or `gh api`), then run
   `./scripts/export-settings.sh` and confirm `git status` is clean — the
   live state now matches the declared state. If the export differs from the
   merged baseline, reconcile immediately (fix the setting or PR a correction).

Break-glass (urgent settings change applied live first): allowed, but the
reconciliation PR (`export-settings.sh` output) must follow within a week —
before the next scheduled drift run — or the drift issue will file itself.
The documented break-glass for the `v*` tag ruleset (bad release tag: disable
→ fix → re-enable) is drift-invisible if completed within one run window, but
record it in an issue regardless — control-plane changes are otherwise
invisible on a personal account.

## Standing secrets (documented exceptions)

The zero-standing-secrets posture above is about broad, long-lived personal
access tokens — it does not forbid every credential. One exception exists,
and it's deliberately narrow:

- `RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (secret) + `RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_ID`
  (variable) — a GitHub App private key, installed only on this repo with
  `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write` and nothing else.
  `release-please.yml` mints a short-lived installation token from it per
  run (`actions/create-github-app-token`) instead of using `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
  because the repo's "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
  requests" setting (`can_approve_pull_request_reviews` in
  `repo-admin-snapshot.json`) is deliberately left off — that setting is
  repo-wide, so turning it on would let every workflow open/approve PRs
  via `GITHUB_TOKEN`, not just this one. A GitHub App key is still a
  stored secret, but it's scoped to two permissions on one repo and
  revocable independently of any personal credential — a materially
  smaller blast radius than a personal PAT with the same reach.

## When the weekly check flags drift

`settings-drift.yml` opens/updates an issue labelled `settings-drift` and the
run goes red. Reconcile **deliberately**: either revert the live setting, or
adopt it by PRing the refreshed export. Never silently re-export to make the
diff go away — the diff is the change record.

## Known blind spots (accepted)

- `bypass_actors` on rulesets is only returned to callers with write access
  to the ruleset, so the weekly job cannot see it; it is recorded in
  `repo-admin-snapshot.json` and re-verified on every manual export.
- Everything in `repo-admin-snapshot.json` drifts silently between manual
  exports. Compensating controls: the process rule above, and the weekly
  OpenSSF Scorecard re-measurement (Branch-Protection, Token-Permissions).
- The repo owner holds admin and can edit any of this at any time — detection
  is possible, prevention is not (single-maintainer reality, see SECURITY.md).
