"""The gaggle integration.

Fetches smart-meter data from the AGL Energy API and feeds it into the
HA Energy dashboard. See AGENTS.md for design notes (Auth0 refresh-token
rotation, daily polling, import_statistics for historical data).

The integration owns its own `aiohttp.ClientSession` (rather than using
HA's shared `async_get_clientsession`) because the TOFU TLS pinning needs
a custom `TCPConnector` subclass — `GagglePinningConnector` — that captures
the leaf-cert SPKI for every new connection. HA's shared session uses HA's
own connector which we cannot subclass. The session is closed in
`async_unload_entry`.
